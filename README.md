# A webstore implementation 

Welcome to our Webstore!

It can be built and run with the command "make assignment2" in the terminal.
The user can then proceed to make choices in the menus. 

The main menu offers the option of choosing to navigate the program either as
an employee or as a customer. Both options offer different possibilities.

As an employee the user can add merchandise (merch), remove merch, edit merch and replenish 
stock for chosen merch.

As a customer the user can add items to the shopping cart, and "buy" those items,
which results in the stock of the item being decreased. The user can create
several shopping carts under different names. 

We hope you will enjoy our virtual webshop, and buy many items! 

P.S. Nerd note: the program uses a custom-built hash-table and linked list implementations.
